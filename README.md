Incomplete port to c#. 

Started to port yowsup to c# a few years ago

Not even sure if this is the correct branch I worked on back then.

Also did the dissononce and consonance libraries. Not sure if its included in this. Will upload if I can find it.

Maybe someone else will find it useful.

Note to get yowsup working you will need to make some changes. Check the TGala's yowsup project's issues and pull requests to figure it out. Its really not that hard.

Still struggling to figure out how to commit to github. Hence Im uploading it all as a zip file
